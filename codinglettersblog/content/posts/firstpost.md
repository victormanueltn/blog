Dear reader,

Welcome to Coding Letters!

My name is Victor Trejo and I am passionate about programming. In this blog, I will write about things I learn in the vast world of software development.

I have two main motivations for starting this blog:

- I want to give back to the community. We often talk about how the internet can be a hostile place, but we easily forget how often we receive quality help for free. This is my way of humbly saying thanks to all those who have selflessly helped me in my journey.

- I want us to learn together. Learning is better when it's a shared experience.

I am very excited about this new adventure and I am looking forward to receiving your feedback!

Warm regards,
Victor Trejo.
